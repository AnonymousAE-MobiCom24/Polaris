# The source code of the artifact submission for Polaris (MobiCom'24)

This repository contains the artifacts and guidelines for ACM Badging in the MobiCom 2024 proceedings.

## Overview
We present Polaris, the first vision-free fiducial marking system, based on a novel, full-stack magnetic sensing design. 
Polaris can achieve reliable and accurate pose estimation and contextual perception, even in NLOS scenarios. 

Its core design includes: (1) a novel digital modulation scheme, Magnetic Orientation-shift Keying (MOSK) that can encode key information like waypoints and coordinates with passive magnets; (2) a robust and lightweight magnetic sensing framework to decode and localize the magnetic tags. 
Our design also equips Polaris with three key features: sufficient encoding capacity, robust detection accuracy, and low energy consumption. 
We have built an end-to-end system of Polaris and tested it extensively in real-world scenarios. The testing results have shown Polaris to achieve an accuracy of up to 0.58 mm and 1&deg; in posture estimation with a power consumption of only 25.08 mW.
